        <div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
            <p>Harmony is a chat app, where you can create and join chatrooms with those on your local network.
                (Think of it as like if PictoChat for the Nintendo DS was made for a computer.) You can change your nickname,
                aswell as whisper to other users if you want to say something to only them. This Webapp is made purely with Rust,
                HTML, and CSS. There is no manually typed JavaScript.

            <p>Harmony was the second of the two projects I built during senior year, as well as the tougher one. My friend Tom Schuster and I built
                this together over the course of 3 months, while simultaneously learning everything on the fly. At the start of this
                project neither of us had any experience in the rust programming language, let alone developing webapps in it. I had
                more of a focus on developing the frontend side of things, whereas Tom worked primarily on the backend. We would often check in and
                explain our findings to eachother, whilst also teaching eachother any of the cool things we had learned. This project was a key part
                in winning us our Highschool's Senior IT Award.
